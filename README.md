# TechBlog_MVC

Writing about tech can be just as important as making it. Developers spend plenty of time creating new applications and debugging existing codebases, but most developers also spend at least some of their time reading and writing about technical concepts, recent advancements, and new technologies.

My goal is to build a CMS-style blog site similar to a Wordpress site, where developers can publish their blog posts and comment on other developersâ€™ posts as well. This application has been deployed using Heroku. This app follows the MVC paradigm in its architectural structure, use Handlebars.js as the templating language, Sequelize as the ORM, and the express-session npm package for authentication.
